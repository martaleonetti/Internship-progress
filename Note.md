# First Week  

- Have a better understanding of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) mechanisms.

\[
\mathcal{L}(\theta) = \langle \psi(\theta) | H | \psi(\theta) \rangle
\]

where \( H \) is the Hamiltonian and \( \psi(\theta) \) is the parameterized quantum state.

- Have a better understanding on stabilizer states and formalism 

- Read "Doped stabilizer states in many-body physics and where to find them"
  (Gu, Oliviero, Leone)

- Understand PGA (need some references about it)

Following...

# VQE 

The variational quantum eigensolver is a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm that approximates the lowest eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector of a given hermitian operator, typically the Hamiltonian of the investigated quantum system. 

**BASIC IDEA**: generate quantum states using a parametrized quantum circuit, the so called ansatz, and classically optimize the parameters. 

- **How It Works**
1. **Hamiltonian Decomposition**:  
   \( H \) is written as a sum of Pauli operators:
   \[
   H = \sum_i c_i P_i
   \]
   Since quantum computers measure Pauli observables, this form is necessary.

2. **Parameterized Quantum Circuit (Ansatz)**:  
   A quantum circuit \( U(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \) generates a trial state:
   \[
   \ket{\psi(\boldsymbol{\theta})} = U(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \ket{0}
   \]
   The choice of ansatz is crucial.

3. **Energy Measurement**:  
   The expectation value is computed:
   \[
   E(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \sum_i c_i \bra{\psi(\boldsymbol{\theta})} P_i \ket{\psi(\boldsymbol{\theta})}
   \]
   Each term is measured separately.

4. **Classical Optimization**:  
   A classical optimizer finds \( \boldsymbol{\theta} \) to minimize \( E(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \). This loop continues until convergence.


- **Difficulties**:
 **Choosing the right ansatz**: Needs to be expressive but efficient.
 **Optimization difficulties**: Some ans√§tze suffer from barren plateaus.
 **Measurement cost**: Evaluating all Pauli terms can be expensive.

# A measurement-based variational quantum eigensolver (2021)

- Propose a new approach to VQEs using the principles of MBQC. 

- Development of a new variational technique based on MBQC, that we call measurement-based VQE.
- Protocols determine the ground state of a target Hamiltonian. 

- Use a tailored entangled state called "custum state" that allows for exploring an appropriate corner of the system's Hilbert space. This custom state includes auxiliary qubits which, once measured, modify the state of the output qubits. (edge-decoration). 
- Start from an ansatz state represented as a graph, this ansatz is modified adding other qubits, these qubits are measured in rotated basis R($\theta$), where $\theta$ are the variational parameters.

- MB-VQE shifts the challenge from performing multi-qubits gates to  creating an entangled initial state. 

- Toric code model, key idea: I don't start from a random state in the Hilbert space, rather I choose an ansatz state $\ket{\psi_a}$ located in a region in the Hilbert space. 

- To make the computation deterministic, so-called byproduct operators and adaptive measurements are required. 

- Photonic quantum systems 

- MB-VQEs are advantageous whenever a perturbation $H_p$ is added to a Hamiltonian $H_0$ whose ground state, used as ansatz state $\ket{\psi_a}$, is a stabilizer state or a graph state. 

**general framework**: 
# Deterministic Ansatze for the MBVQE (Schroeder, Heller and Gachechiladze)
- The study introduces MBVQE-ansatze that respect determinism.

- They study the possible advantages of the MBQC in variational algorithms.

- Determinism is crucial to ensure that the variational steps in the classical training part converge even during the perfect noiseless simulations. 

- Simulations for the Schwinger moderl and the XY-model.
