# First Week  

- Have a better understanding of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) mechanisms.

\[
\mathcal{L}(\theta) = \langle \psi(\theta) | H | \psi(\theta) \rangle
\]

where \( H \) is the Hamiltonian and \( \psi(\theta) \) is the parameterized quantum state.

- Have a better understanding on stabilizer states and formalism 

- Read "Doped stabilizer states in many-body physics and where to find them"
  (Gu, Oliviero, Leone)

- Understand PGA (need some references about it)

Following...

- Try to collect some ideas on extending MBQC-based VQE beyond Stabilizer Hamiltonians.

key question: the MBQC framework naturally suits for stabilizer Hamiltonians, can be extended to more general quantum systems that exhibit non-stabilizer properties?

Some ideas:

# Interesting articles 

*    Stabilizer ground states for simulating quantum many-body physics: theory,
 algorithms, and applications
  (https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08441)


 * (http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13241) starting from this article, would like to try to think about generalization for other problems.
